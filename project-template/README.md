# EZ-Lease

## Overview

EZ-Lease is a tenant <-> landlord communication platform, which makes communications between tenants and landlords quick and easy. Primary users will be landlords who manage one or more properties, and tenants who rent a property from a landlord. 

Tenants might use the application to contact their landlord for maintenance issues, or in regards to the status of their rent payment(s). Landlords might use it to respond to maintenance requests, or remind tenants that their rent is due soon or overdue.

## Application Initialization

To use this application you should have `node` and `npm` installed and issue the following commands:

1. `npm install`: this will install the required `node` libraries.
2. `npm run watch`: this will compile the application code and produce an `App.js` file in the `static` directory. This command will also continue to run until explicitly killed (e.g., control-C).
3. `npm start`: this will run the Express server, `server.js`, allowing you to view the running application in the browser window.
